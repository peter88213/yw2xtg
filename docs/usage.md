The yw2md Python script converts yWriter 7 projects to Markdown 
and creates new yWriter 7 projects from Markdown formatted text documents.

There are two variants, which are distinguished by the file extension: 
_yw2md.pyw_  has a graphical user interface, and  _yw2md.py_  is for the command line. 


# 1. The GUI variant yw2md.pyw

## Usage

It is recommended to create a link on the desktop.

You can either

- launch the program by double-clicking on the program/link icon, or
- launch the program by dragging a source file and dropping it on the program/link icon.

### Options

#### Comments at the beginning of the scene are scene titles

_When checked:_

- When converting from yw7 to md, prefix scene titles as comments.
- When converting from md to yw, convert comments at scene start to scene titles.


_When unchecked:_

- When converting from yw7 to md, do not prefix scene titles as comments.
- When converting from md to yw, do not convert comments at scene start to scene titles.


#### The scenes in the yWriter project are Markdown formatted

_When checked:_

- When converting scenes from yw7 to md, do not double the linefeeds.
- When converting scenes from md to yw, use Markdown.


_When unchecked:_ 

- When converting scenes from yw7 to md, double the linefeeds.
- When converting scenes from md to yw, use yWriter's genuine bold/italic markup.


### Select file

If no file is selected, you first have to select a file. Click on the  __Select file__ 
button and choose a yWriter or Markdown file with the file picker dialog.

You can change the selection at any time.

# 2. The command line variant yw2md.py

This script is meant to be launched from the command line. However, 
if you prefer to use the mouse, you can create a link on the Windows 
desktop, and launch yw2md by dragging the source file and dropping 
it to the link icon. For optional arguments, edit the link's properties.

# Markdown reference

By default,  _yw2md_  converts a Markdown subset according to the following specificatiions:

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are separated by a blank line.
Single blank lines in yWriter scenes are Markdown-encoded by three blank lines.

### Headings

#### Level 1 heading used for parts (chapters marked as  beginning of a new section in yWriter)
`# One hash character at the start of the line`

#### Level 2 heading used for chapters
`## Two hash characters at the start of the line`

### Emphasis

#### Italic 
`*single asterisks*`

__Note__ : A `*` surrounded with spaces will be treated as a literal asterisk.

#### Bold 
`**double asterisks**`

### Comments

- Comments at the start of a scene are condsidered scene titles by default.
- All other comments are converted between Markdown comments and yWriter comments.

`<!---A HTML comment with one additional hyphen--->`
